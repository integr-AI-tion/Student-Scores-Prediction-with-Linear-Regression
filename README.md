This project uses linear regression to predict students' average academic scores based on their study hours and absence days.

I used a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/student-scores?resource=download which contains multiple variables and subject scores.

I chose only to use the variables 'study hours' and 'absence days' because at first, I wanted to keep the model simple and focused on variables that I see as having direct correlation with academic performance.
I also intitially included 'extracurricular activities', however, the data for that variable contained a lot of missing values; to keep the model clean and simple, I removed it.
